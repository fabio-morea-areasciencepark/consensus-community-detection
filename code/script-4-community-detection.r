## community detection using Edge Betweenneess algorithm *************************************************************
## The edge betweenness score of an edge measures the number of shortest paths through it, 
## The idea of the edge betweenness based community structure detection is that it is likely that edges connecting separate modules 
## have high edge betweenness as all the shortest paths from one module to another must traverse through them. 
## So if we gradually remove the edge with the highest edge betweenness score we will get a hierarchical map, a rooted tree, called a dendrogram of the graph. 
## The leafs of the tree are the individual vertices and the root of the tree represents the whole graph

## Weights of the edges is set to NA so E()$weight will not be used for community detection. 
## otherwise edges are interpreted as distances, not as connection strengths
